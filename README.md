# Saturn Workspace Web Platform

- Status: canonical source guide
- Scope: public/customer/admin Web surfaces and Auth, Admin, Policy, and Route Check Workers
- Owner: repository maintainer
- Last verified: 2026-08-23
- Verification: protected `web-required` CI

Canonical Web and control-plane source for Saturn Workspace. The project is
owned and developed by one independent individual/student; the product name
does not imply a registered company or corporate publisher.

## Architecture and ownership

- `site`: React customer, public, and administrator interfaces plus typed API
  adapters and production-cutover checks.
- `workers/auth`: authentication, device linking, account sessions, and OAuth
  configuration delivery.
- `workers/admin`: administrative operations, diagnostics, support, OTA release
  metadata, and provider-disabled commerce routes.
- `workers/policy`: entitlement decisions, notifications, invitations, email
  content, and policy signing.
- `workers/route-check`: short-lived, privacy-bounded browser-origin route
  qualification for the Desktop session lifecycle.
- `workers/shared`: shared subscription and account-domain behavior.
- `contracts`: machine-readable producer contracts consumed by Desktop.
- `tools`: source-promotion, runtime-contract, provenance, and authority checks.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: protected source qualification.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`: manual exact-commit Pages promotion.

The route-check page sends attempt-scoped observations only to Saturn's three
route-check HTTPS origins. Its WebRTC side-route probe also contacts
`stun.cloudflare.com:3478`, a Cloudflare infrastructure boundary that is not
governed by the page's HTTP `connect-src` policy. The page sends no Saturn user
identity, account email, profile identifier, browsing target, or proxy secret;
attempt observations are short-lived and excluded from persistent application
analytics. Infrastructure providers may still create transport-level logs
outside Saturn's application retention controls.

The Desktop source is the separate protected repository
`xSATAAAN/SaturnWorkspace-Desktop`. `contracts/desktop-control-plane.v1.json`
is the Web producer contract; Desktop pins its reviewed content and producer
commit.

## Local qualification

Use Node.js 22 and the committed npm lock files:

```powershell
node --test tools/authority-surface.test.mjs tools/deployment-boundary.test.mjs tools/runtime-contract.test.mjs
node tools/check-authority-surface.mjs
node tools/check-deployment-boundary.mjs

Push-Location site
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test:production-integration
npm run test:production-rollout
npm run test:content
npm run test:admin-surface
Pop-Location

Push-Location workers/admin
npm ci
npm run check:syntax
npm run test:required

```

`npm run dev` or `wrangler dev` is a local development surface only. Local
fixtures and tokens must remain synthetic; never copy real customer or
production data into tests.

## Current product boundaries

- Account connection and entitlement are distinct. A linked account can have no
  subscription, while paid operations remain denied.
- No production payment provider is active. Checkout, manual grants, and
  billing communications stay disabled or fail closed until separately
  approved and externally verified.
- Irreversible account deletion is not approved; do not promise hard deletion.
- Gmail read access remains disabled until provider verification and an explicit
  rollout decision.
- The Route Check Worker source may be adopted through a protected PR, but its
  custom route, Durable Object, and rate-limit binding are not live capability
  until a separately authorized Worker deployment and browser-provider QA.
- Desktop production signing, publisher verification, publication, and release
  remain outside this repository and are deferred.

These boundaries are enforced in runtime code, contracts, and tests. A prose
change cannot activate an integration or authorize an operation.

## Source, deployment, and secrets

Merging a protected pull request adopts source; it does not deploy. GitHub Pages
can be promoted only by manually dispatching `deploy-pages.yml` with the exact
current `main` SHA after `web-required` succeeds. Worker deployment is a separate
operator action and is not automated by this repository.

Route Check retains one random attempt's minimum route observation only for its
bounded TTL and deletes it on finalization or alarm. It receives no Saturn user
identity, mailbox, account/profile identifier, target URL, browsing content, or
proxy credential. Application observability is disabled for this Worker; any
provider-level infrastructure logs outside the application contract remain an
explicit hosting boundary. No merge authorizes deployment or changes that
boundary.

Expected environment bindings are declared by Worker configuration and code.
Secret values belong only in the approved external platform or local ignored
files. Never commit or print `.dev.vars`, service-role keys, Firebase or OAuth
credentials, signing keys, tokens, production payloads, Wrangler state, or real
user data.

## Documentation authority

`AGENTS.md` and this file are the complete active prose surface. Code, contracts,
migrations, configuration, workflows, and tests remain executable authority.
Applied migrations retain historical filenames because their identity is part
of database history; those names do not define current work or product intent.
Git history preserves superseded guidance instead of in-tree archives.
